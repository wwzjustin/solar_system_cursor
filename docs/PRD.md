# Interactive Educational 3D Solar System - Technical Specification

## 1. Overview
A web-based interactive 3D solar system visualization tool designed for educational purposes. This application will allow users to explore the solar system, observe planetary orbits, and learn about celestial bodies through an engaging, hands-on experience. The primary goal is to make astronomy education more interactive and accessible.

## 2. Core Features
- **3D Visualization**: Accurate scale representation of the solar system with all planets and major moons.
- **Interactive Orbits**: Animated planetary orbits with adjustable speed.
- **Camera Controls**: Free navigation through the 3D space with zoom, pan, and rotation capabilities.
- **Custom Texture Uploads**: Ability for users to upload their own textures for the Sun and planets.
- **Educational Information**: Facts and data about each celestial body accessible through UI interactions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and tablet devices with appropriate UI adaptations.

## 3. User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Minimalist UI with essential controls visible and advanced options in expandable panels.
- **Discoverability**: Clear visual cues for interactive elements.
- **Tooltips**: Information appears on hover over celestial bodies.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fluid animations between views and when focusing on specific planets.
- **Learning Path**: Guided tour option for first-time users.
- **Click-to-Run**: Easy simulation controls with play/pause and speed adjustment.
- **Direct Manipulation**: Drag planets to move them or click to focus the camera on them.

## 4. Technical Stack
- **Core Framework**: Three.js for 3D rendering (preferred over Babylon.js for its broader community support and extensive documentation).
- **Physics**: Simplified orbital mechanics calculations.
- **Asset Management**: Pre-optimized 3D models and textures with dynamic loading.
- **Texture Upload System**:
  - Client-side image processing for texture mapping.
  - Drag-and-drop interface with fallback to standard file picker.
  - Support for common image formats (PNG, JPG, WEBP).
  - Resolution and file size limits for performance optimization.
- **State Management**: Custom lightweight solution for application state.
- **Build Tools**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.

## 5. Milestones

### Milestone 1: Static Solar System (2 weeks)
- Basic 3D scene setup with lighting and background.
- Static models of all planets and the Sun with accurate relative sizing.
- Fixed orbital paths visualization.
- Basic camera with orbit controls.
- Planet labels and simple UI framework.

### Milestone 2: Dynamic Interactions (3 weeks)
- Animated planetary orbits with accurate relative speeds.
- Enhanced camera controls with smooth transitions between planets.
- UI controls for simulation speed and pause/play.
- Information panels for each celestial body.
- Zoom levels with appropriate level-of-detail adjustments.

### Milestone 3: Advanced Features (3 weeks)
- Use texture upload images to render the planet, sun, moon, and galaxy
- Real-time texture application to 3D models.
- Educational overlays with detailed information on demand.
- Performance optimizations for slower devices.
- User preference saving (local storage).
- Comprehensive testing across browsers and devices.

## 6. Assets
- High-resolution planet and moon textures (diffuse, normal, and specular maps).
- Star field background.
- UI elements following the design inspiration from the reference image.
- Simplified 3D models optimized for web performance.
- Educational content and facts for each celestial body.

## 7. Stretch Goals
- **Time Controls**: Ability to accelerate time or jump to specific astronomical events.
- **Scale Toggle**: Switch between realistic and simplified scale for better visualization.
- **Constellations**: Toggleable constellation overlay with names and connecting lines.
- **AR Mode**: Mobile AR capability for viewing the solar system in physical space.
- **Celestial Events**: Simulation of eclipses, transits, and other astronomical phenomena.
- **Educational Quiz Mode**: Interactive questions based on the visualized content.

## 8. Non-Goals
- Multiplayer or collaborative features.
- Voice narration or extensive audio elements.
- Scientific-grade accuracy for research purposes.
- VR support (initially).
- Mobile-first design (focus on desktop and tablet initially).
- Offline functionality.
- Real-time data integration with astronomical APIs.

## 9. Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Optimize for 60fps on mid-range hardware.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure basic accessibility features are implemented.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Target modern browsers (latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Memory Management**: Implement proper resource disposal for texture uploads and 3D assets.
